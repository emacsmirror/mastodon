* mastodon.el fork

This is a fork of of the great but seemingly dormant https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el.

It adds the following features:

| Profiles:       |                                                                                    |

It also makes some small cosmetic changes to make timelines easier to read, and makes some functions asynchronous, based on https://github.com/ieure/mastodon.el.

This updated version is not on MELPA, to use it you need to clone and require it as per the installation instructions below.

The minimum Emacs version is now 26.1. But if you are running an older version it shouldn't be very hard to get it working.

I did this for my own use and to learn more Elisp. Feel free to improve it.

** live-updating timelines

(code taken from https://github.com/alexjgriffith/mastodon-future.el.)

Works for federated, local, and home timelines and for notifications. It's pretty necro, sometimes it goes off the rails, so use at your own risk. Not a super high priority for me, but some people dig it. The command prefix is =mastodon-async--stream=.

** NB: dependency

This version depends on the library =request= (for uploading attachments). You can install it from MELPA, or https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request.

** roadmap-ish

I might add a few more features if the ones I added turn out to work ok. Possible additions/amendments:

- [X] update profile note.
- [X] fix loading more notifications re-loads the same ones
- [X] view/accept/reject follow requests in notifications view.
- [X] fix sometimes usernames don't appear in timelines
- [X] voting on polls
- [X] delete and redraft toots
- [X] prevent loss of draft toots by the toot-send bug
- [X] fix scaling of images
- [ ] display post visibility status in timelines
- better display of polls
- display number of boosts/faves in toot byline
- mention all thread participants in replies
- handle newlines in toots better, for poetry, etc.
- improve (or even partially disable) async.

It looks like 2-factor auth was never completed in the original repo. It's not a priority for me, auth ain't my thing. If you want to hack on it, its on the develop branch in the original repo.

* Original README

** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

Add =MELPA= to your archives:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Update and install:

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

=M-x package-install RET mastodon RET=

*** Emoji

=mastodon-mode= will enable [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] if it is loaded in your Emacs environment, so
there's no need to write your own hook anymore. =emojify-mode= is not required.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= can provide a context menu for its keybindings if [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][Discover]] is
installed. It is not required.

if you have Discover, add the following to your Emacs init configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'mastodon-discover)
  (with-eval-after-load 'mastodon (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t
    :config
    (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

** Usage
*** 2 Factor Auth
2FA is not supported yet. It is in the [[https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/milestone/2][plans]] for the =1.0.0= release.

If you have 2FA enabled and try to use mastodon.el, your Emacs client will hang until you `C-g` your way out.
*** Instance

Set =mastodon-instance-url= in your =.emacs= or =customize=. Defaults to the [[https://mastodon.social][flagship]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://my.instance.url")
#+END_SRC

There is an option to have your user credentials (email address and password) saved to disk so you don't have to re-enter them on every restart.
The default is not to do this because if not properly configured it would save these unencrypted which is not a good default to have.
Customize the variable =mastodon-auth-source-file= if you want to enable this feature.

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode so you can see toots. You will be prompted for email and password. The app registration process will take place if your =mastodon-token-file= does not contain =:client_id= and =:client_secret=.

**** Legend

|--------+-------------------------|
| Marker | Meaning                 |
|--------+-------------------------|
| =(B)=  | I boosted this toot.    |
| =(F)=  | I favourited this toot. |
|--------+-------------------------|

*** Toot toot

=M-x mastodon-toot=

Pops a new buffer/window with a =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot. =C-c C-k= cancels.
Both actions kill the buffer and window.

If you have not previously authenticated, you will be prompted for your
account email and password. *NOTE*: Email and password are NOT stored by mastodon.el.

Authentication stores your access token in the =mastodon-auth--token=
variable. It is not stored on your filesystem, so you will have to
re-authenticate when you close/reopen Emacs.

**** Customization
The default toot visibility can be changed by setting or customizing the =mastodon-toot--default-visibility= variable. Valid values are ="public"=, ="unlisted"=, ="private"=, or =direct=.

Toot visibility can also be changed on a per-toot basis from the new toot buffer.

**** Keybindings

|-----------+------------------------|
| Key       | Action                 |
|-----------+------------------------|
| =C-c C-c= | Send toot              |
| =C-c C-k= | Cancel toot            |
| =C-c C-w= | Add content warning    |
| =C-c C-v= | Change toot visibility |
|-----------+------------------------|
